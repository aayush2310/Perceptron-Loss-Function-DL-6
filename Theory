Problems in perceptron trick:-
1)The line obtained from perceptron trick,we cant be perfectly sure that these are the values of w1,w2 and w3.The basic logic of perceptron trick states that if the point
is misclassified,then move the line else not,so we can get more than 1 lines for a problem statement.so,we cant quantify our result.so,its imp. toquantify the soln. by 
using the loss function.

LOSS FUNCTION of Perceptron
=>1)Number of misclassified points.-This has a problem that it is giving same value to every misclassified point.
  2)Calculate the euclidian distance of misclassified points.
  3)What actually is used in the loss function of perceptron is that we put the coordinate points in the eqn of line and find the absolute value,that absolute value is 
    the amount/quantity of loss.
  L(w1,w2,b)=(1/n)*E(i=1 to i=n)L(y(i),f(xi))+(alpha)*R(w1,w2)
  L(y(i),f(xi))=max(0,-y(i)f(xi))  where,f(xi)=w1x1+w2x2+b
  n=number of rows in the data.
  4)Loss function is a method to tell how well is the machine learning algorithm working on my model.
